#Transition Probability Matrix
```{r}
x <- c(1:12) # number of objects. In our case, sounds.

mat <- matrix(0, nrow = length(x), ncol = length(x)) # empty probability matrix

cur <- sample(x, size = 1) # choose which object is 'current object' or 'starting object'.

trials = numeric(100) # number of trials

# generate a probability matrix
for (i in trials){
  cur <- sample(x, size = 1, replace = FALSE, prob = mat[cur, ])
  trials[i + 1] <- cur
}

```
